# SolarSystem

This application uses the same logic as in [SeeThroughOnePaper](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/PaperApp2D) but uses several sheets of paper with different markers.

## Markers

Below are the sheets of paper with the markers used for each object in the solar system you want to display. You can have as many as you want, as long as they are all in the tracking field of the Papart Camera.

## Rendering

Here is the result : each sheet of paper renders its solar system object.
