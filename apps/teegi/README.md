Teegi is a Tangible EEG (ElectroEncephaloGraphy) Interface. It uses a physical puppet on which your brain activity is displayed in real-time. 

It is described on this [official page](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/fr/scientific-subjects/teegi-tangible-eeg-interface/) at Inria.

This is the homepage of the TechFest version, as seen in this video https://vimeo.com/117606948 .
