#Tracking based on images
This application uses images or planar objects to track movement instead of markers.
The name of the tracked image is set in the application code.
The *physical image/planar* object you want to track must have a *digital version* (jpg, png, svg) that must be placed in the application folder.

The tracked image can be captured using the application [ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking).


Bellow we have the result shown.
