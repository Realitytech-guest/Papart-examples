## Interface avec angles draggables pour d√©finir la position manuelle des marqueurs

In this example we want to save a 3D position of a planar object.

First the user enters the real size of the object in the corresponding inputs (see bellow).

Once those parameters are set, the user can arrange the shape of the 3D position he wants to record.
The 1st corner is selected, and he can drag it on the corner of the real image. Then he can press the 2 key and grab the second corner and set it where he wants, and so on.

Anytime the user can arrange the axis thus the orientation of the 3D position, by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

For exemple, we can see bellow that the user wanted to have the Y-Axis going towards the top of the image, so he clicked on the "Change Y Axis button".
