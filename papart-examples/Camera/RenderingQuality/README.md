## RenderingQuality Example

In this example, we show how to change the resolutions involved in an
augmented reality application.

### Screen Resolution

The screen resolution can be changed in the setup(), as shown in
[this file](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/blob/master/papart-examples/Camera/RenderingQuality/RenderingQuality.pde).

If you use a 640x480 pixel camera, the rendering  will be the same
resolution by default. You can make everything look better by increasing
the quality, or speed up your app by decreasing the quality.
