#ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking

This application extracts images defined by user and save them. The interface is a simplified version of [GuiCorners](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/GuiCorners).

Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 and drag the selected corner to define an image to be saved.

Below is a picture of what the application looks like.
