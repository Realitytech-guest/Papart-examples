#Load an External Location
##Application

This application shows how to load a 3D position previously saved.

When any key is pressed, the location saved in the SavedLocation folder is loaded and the marker is set on this position from now on.

##Results

This is the 3D position saved in the [SaveLocation](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/SaveLocation) application.

Here the previous location is loaded and the red rectangle will stay at that position, wherever the marker is.
