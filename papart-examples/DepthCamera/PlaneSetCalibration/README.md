# Plane Set Calibration

This applications calibrates the kinect by setting the 3D position of the planar surface you want to make tactile (that can be a computer screen, a desk, wall...).

# How To

The interface contains a slider PlaneUP (top left), a toggle button UseAR (left) and a Save button (bottom left).

There are two modes: a mode using only the color camera feed, and a mode displaying the depth data from the kinect with color added.
