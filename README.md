# Papart library examples


Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## Quick start guide

#### Work in progress, links are not ready yet. 

PapARt is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library, and it requires many other libraries to work. The smaller ones are included, and the heavy ones are separated.

Current version of Processing: 3.2.3 . Any higher version of Processing 3 should work. Processing 2, and 1 are not supported anymore.  

Download list: 
* [PapARt library](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-default.tgz): PapARt. Special version for [Kinect](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-kinect.tgz), [RealSense](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-realsense.tgz), [PapartHardware2](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-hardware2.tgz), and [PapartHardware3](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-hardware3.tgz).
* [smaller libs](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/libraries.zip): a collection of libraries for math, network, 3D, and GUI.  toxiclibs, processingTUIO, oscP5, GuiModes, skatolo, peasycam, reflections.  
* JavaCV, for your platform [Windows](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-windows-x86_64.tgz), [Linux x86_64](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-linux-x86_64.tgz).

Unpack and install all the libraries to your sketchbook/library directory. Follow this [guide](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) if you are not sure how to install a library. 

It's ready to work ! You can try it with a [webcam](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/quick%20start%20webcam) for your first use.
