# Papart library examples


Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## Quick start guide

#### Work in progress, links are not ready yet. 

PapARt is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library, and it requires many other libraries to work. The smaller ones are included, and the heavy ones are separated.

Current version of Processing: 3.2.3 . Any higher version of Processing 3 should work. Processing 2, and 1 are not supported anymore.  

Download list: 
* [PapARt library](): PapARt, plus many examples. Included : SVGExtended ... (to come)
* [smaller libs](): a collection of libraries for math, network, 3D, and GUI.  toxiclibs, processingTUIO, oscP5, GuiModes, skatolo, peasycam, reflections.  
* JavaCV, for your platform [Windows x64](), [Linux x64](), [MacOSX](), [all platforms](). 

Unpack and install all the libraries to your sketchbook/library directory. Follow this [guide](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) if you are not sure how to install a library. 

It's ready to work ! You can try it with a [webcam](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/quick%20start%20webcam) for your first use.
