# Papart library examples


Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## PapARt 1.0 is out. 

The first big release is out. We look forward for feedback and issue reports. We will enhance the guides and create tutorials, and for this any help will be appreciated ! 

**2017 update: PapARt is now working on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.**

## Quick start guide

PapARt is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library, and it requires many other libraries to work. The smaller ones are included, and the heavy ones are separated.

Current version of Processing: 3.2.3 . Any higher version of Processing 3 should work. Processing 2, and 1 are not supported anymore.
