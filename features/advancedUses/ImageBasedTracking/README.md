#Tracking based on images
##Application
This application uses images or planar objects to track movement instead of markers.
The name of the tracked image is set in the application code.

The *physical image / planar object* you want to track must have a *digital version* (jpg, png, svg) that must be placed in the application folder.

This digital version / tracked image can be captured using the application [ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking).

##Results
Bellow we have the result shown. The application sets a transparent blue background and draws a green rectangle.

The road images works from now on as a classic PapART marker.
